//! Raw `AssemblyProcessor` table representation.
//!
//! This module provides low-level access to `AssemblyProcessor` metadata table data through the
//! [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::raw::AssemblyProcessorRaw`] structure. The
//! `AssemblyProcessor` table contains CPU architecture targeting information for .NET assemblies,
//! though it is rarely used in modern applications.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Like [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyos::AssemblyOsRaw`], `AssemblyProcessor` contains only primitive
//! values and requires no heap resolution, making the "raw" and "owned" representations
//! functionally identical. This simplifies the dual variant pattern used throughout the
//! metadata system.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::raw::AssemblyProcessorRaw`] - Raw table row structure
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyprocessor::AssemblyProcessorRc`] - Reference-counted owned representation
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::types::RowReadable`] - Table parsing interface implementation
//!
//! # `AssemblyProcessor` Table Format
//!
//! The `AssemblyProcessor` table (0x21) contains CPU architecture targeting information:
//! - **Processor** (4 bytes): Processor architecture identifier
//!
//! # Historical Context
//!
//! This table was designed for early .NET Framework scenarios where assemblies might need
//! explicit CPU architecture declarations. Modern .NET applications typically use `AnyCPU`
//! compilation and rely on runtime JIT optimization for architecture-specific code generation.
//!
//! # Architecture Evolution
//!
//! - **Early .NET**: Explicit x86, x64, IA64 targeting in metadata
//! - **Framework Era**: Platform-specific compilation with runtime detection
//! - **Modern .NET**: `AnyCPU` with runtime JIT optimization and cross-platform support
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables`] - Core metadata table infrastructure
//! - [`crate::metadata::token`] - Token representation for metadata references
//! - [`crate::file::io`] - Binary data reading utilities
//!
//! # References
