/// Macro that provides unified dispatch from TableId enum values to their corresponding Raw table types.
///
/// This macro eliminates code duplication across the framework by providing a single source of truth
/// for TableId → Raw type mapping. It takes an expression that will be applied to each Raw type,
/// enabling generic operations across all metadata table types.
///
/// # Usage Examples
///
/// For table row size calculation:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::metadata::tables::dispatch_table_type;
/// dispatch_table_type!(table_id, |RawType| RawType::row_size(table_info))
/// ```
///
/// For table writing operations:
/// ```rust,ignore  
/// use crate::metadata::tables::dispatch_table_type;
/// dispatch_table_type!(table_id, |RawType| {
///     if let Some(table) = self.tables_header.table::<RawType>() {
///         self.write_typed_table(table, table_offset)
///     } else {
///         Ok(0)
///     }
/// })
/// ```
///
/// For generic table operations:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::metadata::tables::dispatch_table_type;
/// dispatch_table_type!(table_id, |RawType| {
///     // Any operation that needs to work with the concrete Raw type
///     process_table::<RawType>(context)
/// })
/// ```
///
/// # Design Pattern
///
/// This macro implements the "dispatch to concrete type" pattern, allowing code to:
/// 1. Accept a runtime `TableId` value
/// 2. Map it to the corresponding compile-time `*Raw` type
/// 3. Execute type-specific operations with full type safety
/// 4. Avoid large match statements and code duplication
///
/// The pattern is essential for metadata operations that need to work generically
/// across all table types while maintaining type safety and performance.
///
/// # Framework Usage
///
/// This macro is successfully used throughout the framework for:
/// - Table row size calculations during binary generation
