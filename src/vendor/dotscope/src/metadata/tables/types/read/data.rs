//! # Table Data Enumeration Module
//!
//! This module defines the unified enumeration for all possible metadata tables that can exist
//! in a .NET CLI assembly's metadata stream. The `#~` or `#-` stream contains a collection of these
//! tables, each representing different aspects of the assembly's type system and metadata.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The .NET metadata format organizes information into a series of structured tables, as defined
//! in ECMA-335. Each table type contains specific kinds of metadata records, such as type
//! definitions, method signatures, field information, and assembly references. This module
//! provides a type-safe enumeration that can hold any of these table types.
//!
//! ## Usage Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use dotscope::metadata::tables::types::TableData;
//!
//! fn process_table(table: &TableData) {
//!     match table {
//!         TableData::TypeDef(type_table) => {
//!             println!("Processing {} type definitions", type_table.row_count);
//!             for type_def in type_table.iter() {
//!                 // Process each type definition
//!             }
//!         }
//!         TableData::MethodDef(method_table) => {
//!             println!("Processing {} method definitions", method_table.row_count);
//!             // Process methods in parallel for better performance
//!             method_table.par_iter().for_each(|method| {
//!                 // Process each method definition
//!             });
//!         }
//!         _ => {
//!             // Handle other table types as needed
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Unified enumeration representing all possible metadata tables in a CLI assembly.
///
/// This enum provides a type-safe way to handle any of the metadata tables that can exist
/// in the `#~` or `#-` stream of a .NET assembly. Each variant corresponds to a specific table type
/// as defined in ECMA-335, containing a [`crate::metadata::tables::types::MetadataTable`] with the appropriate row type.
///
/// ## Table Organization
///
/// The variants are organized to follow the standard table numbering scheme used in
/// .NET metadata, making it easy to map between table IDs and enum variants.
///
/// ## Pattern Matching
///
/// This enum is designed for pattern matching to handle different table types:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use dotscope::metadata::tables::types::TableData;
///
/// fn analyze_table(table: &TableData) -> String {
///     match table {
///         TableData::TypeDef(types) => {
///             format!("Found {} type definitions", types.row_count)
///         }
///         TableData::MethodDef(methods) => {
///             format!("Found {} method definitions", methods.row_count)
///         }
///         TableData::Field(fields) => {
///             format!("Found {} field definitions", fields.row_count)
///         }
///         // Handle other table types...
///         _ => "Other table type".to_string(),
///     }
