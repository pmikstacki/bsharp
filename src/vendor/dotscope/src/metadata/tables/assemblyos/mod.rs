//! `AssemblyOS` table module
//!
//! Provides complete support for the ECMA-335 `AssemblyOS` metadata table (0x22), which contains
//! operating system platform information for assemblies. This module includes raw table access,
//! collection types, and platform identification utilities.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyos::AssemblyOsRaw`]: Raw table structure (no heap resolution needed)
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyos::AssemblyOs`]: Type alias to Raw since all data is self-contained
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyos::loader::AssemblyOsLoader`]: Internal loader for processing `AssemblyOS` table data
//! - Type aliases for efficient collections and reference management
//!
//! # `AssemblyOS` Table Structure
//!
//! The `AssemblyOS` table contains platform targeting information:
//! - **`OSPlatformId`**: Operating system platform identifier (4 bytes)
//! - **`OSMajorVersion`**: Major version number of the target OS (4 bytes)
//! - **`OSMinorVersion`**: Minor version number of the target OS (4 bytes)
//!
//! # Historical Context
//!
//! This table was designed for early .NET Framework scenarios where assemblies might need
//! to specify explicit OS compatibility. Modern .NET applications typically rely on runtime
//! platform abstraction and conditional compilation instead of metadata-level OS targeting.
//!
//! # Reference

///
/// Unlike other metadata tables that reference string or blob heaps, `AssemblyOS` contains
/// only integer values, making the "raw" and "owned" representations identical.
