//! Owned `AssemblyRef` table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::owned::AssemblyRef`] struct
//! which contains fully resolved assembly reference metadata with owned data and resolved heap
//! references. This is the primary data structure for representing external assembly dependencies
//! in a usable form after the dual variant resolution phase.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The owned representation stores fully resolved data from the `AssemblyRef` metadata table,
//! including resolved string and blob heap references. This eliminates the need for heap
//! lookups during runtime access, providing immediate access to assembly reference metadata.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::owned::AssemblyRef`] - Main owned assembly reference structure
//! - [`crate::metadata::identity::Identity`] - Strong name identity information
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::AssemblyRefHash`] - Assembly hash verification data
//! - [`crate::metadata::customattributes::CustomAttributeValueList`] - Custom attribute collection
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with:
//! - [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::raw`] - Raw table representation
//! - [`crate::metadata::identity`] - Strong name identity handling
//! - [`crate::metadata::customattributes`] - Custom attribute processing
//! - [`crate::metadata::token`] - Token-based metadata references

/// Represents a .NET assembly reference with fully resolved metadata and owned data
///
/// This structure contains the complete assembly reference information from the `AssemblyRef`
/// metadata table (0x23), with all heap references resolved to owned strings and byte arrays.
/// Unlike [`crate::metadata::tables::assemblyref::raw::AssemblyRefRaw`], this provides
/// immediate access to string data without requiring heap lookups.
///
/// # Assembly Reference Identity
///
/// An assembly reference's identity consists of:
/// - **Simple name**: The assembly name (e.g., "mscorlib", "System.Core")
/// - **Version**: Four-part version number (Major.Minor.Build.Revision)
/// - **Culture**: Localization culture (None for culture-neutral assemblies)
/// - **Public key or token**: Strong name verification data (optional)
/// - **Hash**: Optional hash value for assembly integrity verification
///
/// # Additional Metadata
///
/// This structure also includes data from related tables:
/// - **`AssemblyRefOS`**: Operating system compatibility information
/// - **`AssemblyRefProcessor`**: Processor architecture requirements
/// - **Custom attributes**: Additional metadata applied to the reference
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This type is [`Send`] and [`Sync`]. Atomic fields (OS and processor data) can be
/// safely accessed and modified from multiple threads. Other fields are read-only
/// after construction and safe for concurrent access.
