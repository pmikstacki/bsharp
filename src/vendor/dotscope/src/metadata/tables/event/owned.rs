//! Owned Event table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::event::owned::Event`] struct
//! which contains fully resolved event metadata with owned data and resolved references.
//! This is the primary data structure for representing .NET event definitions in a usable
//! form after the dual variant resolution phase.

/// Represents a .NET CIL event with fully resolved metadata and owned data
///
/// This structure contains complete event information from the Event metadata table (0x14),
/// with all heap references resolved to owned strings and type references. Unlike
/// [`crate::metadata::tables::event::raw::EventRaw`], this provides immediate access to
/// event data without requiring heap lookups or coded index resolution.
///
/// # .NET Event Model
///
/// Events in .NET provide a standardized notification mechanism with these characteristics:
/// - **Type Safety**: Event handler type is enforced at compile time
/// - **Multicast Support**: Multiple subscribers can attach to a single event
/// - **Standard Accessors**: Add/remove methods with optional raise and other operations
/// - **Observer Pattern**: Clean separation between event source and subscribers
///
/// # Event Accessor Methods
///
/// Events are associated with accessor methods that implement the event semantics:
/// - **Add**: Subscribe a handler to the event (required)
/// - **Remove**: Unsubscribe a handler from the event (required)
/// - **Raise**: Trigger the event (optional, often fire_ or on_ prefixed)
/// - **Other**: Additional custom operations (optional)
///
