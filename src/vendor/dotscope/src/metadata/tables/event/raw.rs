//! Raw Event table representation.
//!
//! This module provides the [`crate::metadata::tables::event::raw::EventRaw`] struct
//! for low-level access to Event metadata table data with unresolved heap indexes and coded indices.
//! This represents the binary format of event records as they appear in the metadata tables stream,
//! requiring resolution to create usable data structures.
//!
//! # Event Table Format
//!
//! The Event table (0x14) contains event definitions with these fields:
//! - **`EventFlags`** (2 bytes): Event attributes bitmask
//! - **Name** (2/4 bytes): String heap index for event name
//! - **`EventType`** (2/4 bytes): `TypeDefOrRef` coded index for event handler type
//!
//! Events define notification mechanisms that types can expose. They are associated
//! with accessor methods (add/remove/raise/other) through the `MethodSemantics` table.
//!
//! # Reference
