//! indexes for initial parsing and memory-efficient storage.

/// Raw representation of a Module table entry with unresolved indexes.
///
/// This structure represents the unprocessed entry from the Module metadata table
/// (ID 0x00), which provides information about the current module including its name,
/// GUID (Mvid), and generation. It contains raw index values that require resolution
/// to actual metadata objects.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// The Module table serves as the foundational identity table for .NET assemblies:
/// - Provides module name and unique identifier (Mvid)
/// - Contains generation and Edit and Continue information
/// - Always contains exactly one row per PE file
/// - Serves as an anchor for other metadata references
///
/// ## Raw vs Owned
///
/// This raw variant is used during initial metadata parsing and contains:
/// - Unresolved heap indexes requiring lookup
/// - Minimal memory footprint for storage
/// - Direct representation of file format
///
/// Use [`Module`] for resolved references and runtime access.
///
/// ## ECMA-335 Reference
///
/// Corresponds to ECMA-335 §II.22.30 Module table structure.
pub struct ModuleRaw {
    /// Row identifier within the Module table.
